In this assignment we have just extended the Assignment 9. 
So in starting we set the values of the N and x and then in the 4th stage that is memory access stage if the instruction is memory based that is load or store 
then I generate a random number between 0 to 1000 and divide it by 1000.
Then if the value is less than x then I stalled the pipeline for N-1 stage otherwise not.

All the other things are same as Assignment9.
